## About Me

👋 Hello, World! I'm Harun and I have been using Kotlin for over a year to develop and share Android applications, aiming to stay up to date with the latest trends in the industry. I'm passionate about learning and constantly improving my skills.

🔭 Currently, I'm working on personal projects to enhance my expertise in Android app development and Kotlin programming.

🌱 I'm always eager to learn and expand my knowledge, especially in the areas of Java and Kotlin. I'm open to collaborating with a team where I can further develop my skills.

If you are interested in working together or have any suggestions, feel free to reach out to me!
